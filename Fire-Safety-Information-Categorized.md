**Key Concepts and Safety Tips (Comprehensive):**

**A. Fire Fundamentals (Origins, Characteristics, Classes, Spread):**
*   **Definition of Fire:** Rapid oxidation, chemical reaction with fuel, heat, oxygen.
*   **Fire Tetrahedron:** Fuel, Heat, Oxygen, and Chemical Chain Reaction. Removing any element extinguishes fire.
*   **Characteristics:** Fast (spreads quickly), Hot (intense heat, flashover risk), Dark (smoke obscures vision), Deadly (toxic fumes and smoke inhalation).
*   **Fire Spread Methods:**
    *   **Conduction:** Heat transfer through direct contact (e.g., flames touching objects, heated pipes).
    *   **Convection:** Heat transfer by fluid movement (e.g., rising hot air, smoke spreading horizontally at ceiling level).
    *   **Radiation:** Heat transfer by infrared waves (e.g., radiant heat from flames to nearby objects).
*   **Classes of Fire (by Fuel Type):**
    *   **Class A:** Ordinary Combustibles (wood, paper, fabric, rubber, plastics). Produce ash. Extinguished by cooling (water, baking soda, salt, damp cloth, sand/soil).
    *   **Class B:** Flammable Liquids and Gases (petrol, oil, paint, alcohol, propane, butane). Extinguished by smothering (foam, CO2). *Not* water.
    *   **Class C:** Electrical (energized electrical equipment). Extinguished by non-conductive agents (dry chemical, CO2, sand/mud, fire blanket). *Not* water.
    *   **Class D:** Combustible Metals (magnesium, sodium, potassium, titanium, aluminum). Requires special dry powder agents. *Not* water.
    *   **Class K:** Cooking Oils and Fats (grease, vegetable oil, animal fat). Extinguished by wet chemical, foam, or fire blanket. *Not* water (can worsen).

**B. Common Causes of Fires & Prevention Tips:**
