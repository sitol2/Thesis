            "query": "What is 'fuel' in the context of fire?",
            "response": "Fuel is anything that can burn and contains chemical potential energy, appearing as a solid, liquid, or gas. Different materials have a 'fire point,' which is the minimum temperature at which they emit sufficient vapors to ignite."

          {
            "query": "How does oxygen affect a fire?",
            "response": "Oxygen acts as the oxidizing agent for combustion. The amount of available oxygen controls the speed of the reaction; abundant oxygen accelerates it, while diminished oxygen slows it down (e.g., rusting). Air contains about 21% oxygen, and most fires require at least 16% to burn."
          },
          {
            "query": "How does fire spread?",
            "response": "Fire spreads through three main methods of heat transfer: Conduction (direct contact), Convection (movement of heated fluids like air, especially dangerous in enclosed spaces), and Radiation (infrared heat waves)."

          {
            "query": "Why are some fires more toxic than others?",
            "response": "Some fires produce toxic smoke due to the elements being burned. For example, burning carbon yields carbon dioxide, and sulfur produces sulfur dioxide. Refrigerant (R134A) from refrigerator fires can release hydrogen fluoride, which forms hydrofluoric acid in the lungs."

            "query": "Describe the Ignition (Incipient) Stage of a fire.",
            "response": "The incipient stage is when a fire is easiest to suppress and causes the most minor damage. Automated fire suppression systems are effective at this point as manual extinguishment is difficult due to the time it takes to identify the fire and locate equipment."

          {
            "query": "What is 'flashover' during a fire?",
            "response": "Flashover is a transitional phase in compartment fires where all exposed surfaces simultaneously reach their ignition temperature, causing the fire to spread rapidly throughout the entire space. Temperatures can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit in seconds, and human survival is unlikely."

It should never be used on solely electrical fires or live wires."
